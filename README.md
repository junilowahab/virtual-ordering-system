# virtual-ordering-system
This is an original project idea for a neighbour restaurant. I want to see how i can apply proper problem solving skills to achieve this task.

This a website for item 7 chops that will enable its customers to place available orders online, choose their payment method and choose their delivery method(either pickup or home delivery).
